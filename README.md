Simply install with `dotnet tool install -g colortest `   
then run `colortest`

# For Mac Users with zsh
This tool is made by my MacBook.  
And I noticed that I can't run with zsh by default.  
You'll need add `$HOME/.dotnet/tools` to your `.zshrc` file like:  
```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
```
